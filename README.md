# webshop

This is a simple webshop application I build to get more familiar with Angular.
I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbauf9IgsC4) tutorial.

## How to run locally
1. Startup the UI by running `ng serve` in folder `/store`.
2. Start the server by running `node /server/.server.js`
3. Navigate to http://localhost:4200 with your browser.
